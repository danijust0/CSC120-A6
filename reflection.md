- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think that inheritance is a good way to make associations in your programming more organized. I like the way it acts similarly to a cookie cutter, allowing you to create similar objects quickly, but also make small alterations to them. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found it difficult to print the library collection at first. I first tried to loop through, but figured it wouldn't be possible with a hashtable, so instead, I used the hastable toString method. It worked well, but I wonder if there's a way to make it look better.
